# functions
This folder contains a bunch of functions for data management and visualization that I find useful for my daily use of R. 
The functions are embedded in a (simple and minimalist) R package. A couple of these functions (pmf, make.spaghetti) are directly borrowed from my [ptmixed package](https://github.com/m-signo/ptmixed) that can be downloaded from CRAN.

Here's how you can install it from the R console:

> install.packages("https://github.com/m-signo/functions/raw/master/msigno_0.2.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

Alternatively, you can download the tarball and install it manually.
