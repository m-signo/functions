# functions
This folder contains a bunch of functions I find useful, embedded in a (simple and minimal) R package.

Here's how you can install it from the R console:
download.file("https://github.com/m-signo/functions/blob/master/msigno_0.0.1.tar.gz", 
    "msigno")
install.packages("msigno", repos = NULL, type = "source")
