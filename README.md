# functions
This folder contains a bunch of functions I find useful, embedded in a (simple and minimalist) R package.

Here's how you can install it from the R console:

download.file("https://github.com/m-signo/functions/blob/master/msigno_0.1.1.tar.gz", 
    "msigno")
    
install.packages("msigno", repos = NULL, type = "source")

Alternatively, you can download the tarball and install it manually.
